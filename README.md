(Using Github page formatting features)

**Purpose** : determine ease of use for end user contribution across users and projects 

**Considerations** 
  - inline images
  - SQL syntax and highlighting 
  - images stored in another folder within the repo 

**Cons**
  - A lot of unique formatting nuances that vary (spacing, indenting, bolding)

**Benefits** 
  - Somewhat understandable/intuitive formatting nuances 
  - Ability to call out users or teams within the organization which triggers a notification (@cmh36346) 
  - Ability to reference specific issues and pages

**Formatting Nuances**
   - Headers: precede titles using #, ##, or ######
   - Spacing: pressing enter key once will push text to the next line in the editor field but requires being hit twice to produce a correctly spaced final github page
